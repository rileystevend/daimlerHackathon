context:
  variables:
    iResult: "nlpresult"

#The syntax for defining the variables is variablename: "variableType".
# The "variableType" can be defined as a primitive type ("string", "boolean", "int", "float", "double"), "list", "map", "resourcebundle", or an entity name. A variable can also hold the results returned by the Intent Engine. For these variables, the "variableType" must be "nlpresult" (for example, iResult: "nlpresult").

#states is where you can define the various states within your flow.
# The syntax for defining a state is
# statename:
#   component:Specify the component you want to use. This can be either a Built-In or custom component.
#   properties:
#     property1: "value" (These are the properties to the specified component
#   transitions: You can specify one of the following four
#     next: Specify the state you want to execute next after this state. By default it will execute the state specified after this
#     error: Specify the state you want to execute in case the component encounters any error in execution.
